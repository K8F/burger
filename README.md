# Burger App

## About this Project 

This app lets users create a list of burgers.  When they "eat" the burger, it's moved to a different list and crossed out. 

The Burger app is a full stack application. The front end uses HTML to render the webpage,  Handlebars to create an HTML template, and CSS for styling.  The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express. Information is stored in a MySQL database. This app also uses a custom ORM to run read, write, and update queries to the database.
